#### Column names for Saccades Dataframe
Some features were adapted from the popEye R package ([github](https://github.com/sascha2schroeder/popEye))
The if the column depend on a line assignment then a _ALGORITHM_NAME will be at the end of the name.
- subject: Subject name or ID (derived from filename)
- trial_id: Trial ID
- item: Item ID
- condition: Condition (if applicable)
- num: Saccade number
- start_time: Start time (in ms since start of the trial)
- end_time: End time (in ms since start of the trial)
- xs: Raw x start position (in pixel)
- ys: Raw y start position (in pixel)
- xe: Raw x end position (in pixel)
- ye: Raw y end position (in pixel)
- ampl: saccadic amplitude (degrees)
- pv: peak velocity (degrees/sec)
- start_uncorrected: Start time (in ms as recorded by EyeLink)
- stop_uncorrected: End time (in ms as recorded by EyeLink)
- blink_before: Whether a blink occured directly before the saccade
- blink_after: Whether a blink occured directly after the saccade
- blink: Whether a blink occured directly before or after the saccade
- duration: Duration (in ms)
- xe_minus_xs: Horizontal saccade distance
- ye_minus_ys: Vertical saccade distance
- eucledian_distance: Eucledian distance
- angle: Angle
- dX: Horizontal saccade amplitude
- dY: Vertical saccade amplitude
- ys_ALGORITHM_NAME: Corrected y start position (in pixel), i.e. after line assignment
- ye_ALGORITHM_NAME: Corrected y end position (in pixel), i.e. after line assignment
- ye_minus_ys_ALGORITHM_NAME: Vertical saccade distance after being snapped to line
- angle_ALGORITHM_NAME: Vertical saccade distance after being snapped to line
- lines_ALGORITHM_NAME: Starting line of saccade
- linee_ALGORITHM_NAME: Landing line of saccade
- line_word_s_ALGORITHM_NAME: Number of word on line from which saccade starts
- line_word_e_ALGORITHM_NAME: Number of word on line where saccade ends
- lets_ALGORITHM_NAME: Number of letter from which saccade starts
- lete_ALGORITHM_NAME: Number of letter where saccade ends
