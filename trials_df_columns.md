#### Column names for Trials Dataframe
Some features were adapted from the popEye R package ([github](https://github.com/sascha2schroeder/popEye))
The if the column depend on a line assignment then a _ALGORITHM_NAME will be at the end of the name.
- subject: Subject name or ID (derived from filename)
- trial_id: Trial ID
- item: Item ID
- condition: Condition (if applicable)
- average_y_correction_ALGORITHM_NAME: Average difference between raw y position of a fixation and the center of the line to which it was assigned in pixels
- Number of fixations before cleaning: Number of fixation found for the trial before any cleaning is done
- Discard long fixations: Indicates if overly long fixations were discarded
- Number of discarded long fixations: Number of fixations that were discarded due to being overly long
- Number of discarded long fixations (%): Number of fixations that were discarded due to being overly long as a percentage of the total number of fixations
- How short and close fixations were handled: Which option was chosen for handling short fixation
- Number of merged fixations: Number of fixations that were merged due to their duration being below the set threshold and being in horizontal proximity to their preceeding or subsequent fixation
- Number of merged fixations (%): Number of fixations that were merged due to their duration being below the set threshold and being in horizontal proximity to their preceeding or subsequent fixation as a percentage of the total number of fixations
- Far out of text fixations were discarded: Whether fixations were discarded if they were far outside the stimulus text
- Number of discarded far-out-of-text fixations: Number of fixations that were discarded due to being far outside the stimulus text
- Number of discarded far-out-of-text fixations (%): Number of fixations that were discarded due to being far outside the stimulus text as a percentage of the total number of fixations
- Total number of discarded and merged fixations: Number of fixations that were cleaned up
- Total number of discarded and merged fixations (%): Number of fixations that were cleaned up as a percentage of the total number of fixations
- trial_start_time: Timestamp of the start of the trial
- trial_end_time: Timestamp of the end of the trial
- question_correct: Whether the question associated with the trial was answered correctly. This will be blank if it could not be determined
- number_of_words_in_trial: Total number of words in the stimulus used for the trial
- blink: Number of blinks detected during the trial
- nfix: Number of fixations remaining after cleaning
- nrun_ALGORITHM_NAME: Number of runs on trial
- saccade_length_ALGORITHM_NAME: Average saccade length across the trial
- mean_fix_duration_ALGORITHM_NAME: Average fixation duration across the trial
- total_fix_duration_ALGORITHM_NAME: Total fixation duration across the trial
- skip_ALGORITHM_NAME: Proportion of words in the trial that have been skipped during first-pass reading
- refix_ALGORITHM_NAME: Proportion of words in the trial that have been refixated
- reg_ALGORITHM_NAME: Proportion of words which have been regressed into
- firstpass_ALGORITHM_NAME: First-pass reading time
- rereading_ALGORITHM_NAME: Re-reading time (total reading time minus first-pass reading time)
- reading_rate_ALGORITHM_NAME: Reading rate (words per minute)
